# Movies-ETL

## Overview

The content streaming platform 'Amazing Prime' is sponsoring a hackathon for movie popularity prediction. As a data analyist, I have been tasked with providing a clean dataset for the hackathon participants to use. In this project repository, I have included the files storing the detailed ETL (Extract, Transform, & Load) process that I undertook for this project, as well as the automated pipeline I created to preform the ETL process with increased efficiency in the future. Below is a brief description of the contents for each jupyter notebook and relevant resources in the repository.
